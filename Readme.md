This is the code for work of Miti-DETR, which is based on the work from Facebook,https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr

Please follow the steps inllustrated in the detr github from Facebook according to the web addresss listed above, but just run the main_v1.py instead of main.py instead, which would call our module instead of the original DETR.
